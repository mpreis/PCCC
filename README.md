# PCCC - PseudoCode C Compiler
## Compiler Construction Class, University of Salzburg

The goal is to develop a self-compiling compiler. I have developed a full functionally compiler in a non-trivial subset of C together with another student. Target is a DLX-based emulator. My self-compiling compiler is called PCCC and was the best project of the class.
